        <p><i><b>The Raincoat Foundation</b> was founded in 2015 by <b>Mikaela</b> and <b>Peter Granström</b>. Clean water is a non-issue to most swedes as it flows on demand from every tap around our cities and villages.To some 650 million people on this earth it just doesn’t happen
that way. We didn´t start <b>Raincoat</b> with a clear idea or innovation that will get this mess fixed but what we can do is to give to those
individuals and organisations that have a plan.</i></p>
        <p><i><b>Our policy is simple — We support initiative that will create awareness and knowledge where it is low and we support solution-oriented water projects where our actions willmake a real difference.</b></i></p>
